Hey! Welcome to Davids Cookies, a Javascript-focused assignment I did while studying the Front End Developer Program at Mediainstitutet. This was the first time I used Javascript but it went well and I had alot of fun while learning! Hava a look!

The site is a small webshop selling cookies of all kinds. There are sorting functions, updating products and arrays, discounts depending on time and day, validating forms with Javascript and much more!
